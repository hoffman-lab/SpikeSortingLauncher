# SpikeSortingLauncher
Spike Sorting launcher: setup, tutorial, examples, best practice for Hoffman Lab data
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository will help you get started spike sorting for high resoluton probes like DBC's Deep array probes 64, 128 ch (or Neuropixels probes). 

The software you need and example data are either linked to or reside on the lab's file server [Synology/datahome_2/AnalysisTools/SpikeSorting/](https://129.59.231.19:5001//datahome_2/AnalysisTools/SpikeSorting/`).
